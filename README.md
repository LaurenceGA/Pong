# Pong
Pong made in Golang  
Code is rough and needs to be cleaned up  

Warning: Many features such as collision detection have been hacked in and should be replaced with propper systems

Up and Down arrow keys move the left paddle, first to 10 wins.  

## Dependencies  
Acquire using:  
> go get github.com/LaurenceGA/Pong 

However, note that most of go-gl's bindings require bindings to already be on your system. At least with the versions this was programmed in. Newer go-gl OpenGL and GLFW libraries have built in dependencies.
